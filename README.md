# Easy Recruit

Mod for the game [Caves of Qud](http://www.cavesofqud.com). Allows the player to recruit almost anyone, by implementing the wish:
```
EasyRecruit [enable|disable]
```
It should work with new games or save games.

## Potentially Redundant

This mod provides similar functionality to the wish, `beguile`. See https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Wishes for more information.

## Instructions

1. Install the mod by downloading this repository and placing it in the Caves of Qud `Mods` folder, located in the Caves of Qud user data folder, next to `Saves`.
    - Alternatively, see below for the Steam Workshop page.
2. Launch Caves of Qud and make sure you have mods enabled in the options. Easy Recruit should appear in the mod list.
3. Enable Easy Recruit, then start a new game or load a save.
    - If loading a save, there will be a warning about active mods not matching the save. Select the option that uses the currently loaded mods.
4. Use the wish:
    ```
    EasyRecruit enable
    ```
    to enable the mod. You will now have the option to recruit NPCs when conversing with them.
    - Wishing can be enabled in the game's options menu.
5. When you want to deactive the mod, use the wish:
    ```
    EasyRecruit disable
    ```

- Alternatively, you can omit the qualifier to toggle the mod, like so:
    ```
    EasyRecruit
    ```

### **Note**

The mod can be uninstalled at any time.
