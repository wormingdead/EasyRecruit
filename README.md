# Easy Recruiting
 Mod for the game [Caves of Qud](http://www.cavesofqud.com/). Allows the player to recruit almost anyone.

It should work with new games or save games.

## Instructions

1. Install the mod by downloading this repository and placing it in the Caves of Qud `Mods` folder, located in the Caves of Qud user data folder, next to `Saves`.
    - Alternatively, see below for the Steam Workshop page.
2. Launch CoQ and make sure you have mods enabled in the options. Easy Recruiting should appear in the mod list.
3. Enable Easy Recruiting.
4. Start a new game, or load a save.
    - If loading a save, there will be a warning about active mods not matching the save. Select the option that uses the currently loaded mods.
5. You can now talk to NPCs to ask them to join you.

### **Important**

When you want to disable the mod, you **MUST** first use the wish:

```
EasyRecruitingCleanup
```

This will restore base game save compatibility. Wishing can be enabled in the options menu.
